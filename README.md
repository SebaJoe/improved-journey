# neural-nets
This repository is for neural net projects:

## from-scratch 
contains an ongoing project to create a functioning neural network class without the use of any AI libraries.
All the code is written entirely in C++, and it all includes a matrix library.

Things to-do:
  - Implement a gradient descent algorithm 
  - Implement backpropagation for the bias matrices
The code for this project was heavily inspired by Welch Labs.
